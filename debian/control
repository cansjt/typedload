Description: Python3 module to load and dump data into typed structures
 This module provides an API to load dictionaries and list (usually loaded
 from json) into Python's NamedTuples, sets, enums, and various other typed
 data structures.
 .
 It also allows one to dump them from typed data structures to json-like
 dictionaries and lists.
 .
 This allows all the code that uses external data to have the advantages
 of using types, and causes all errors with the data to be noticed when it
 is loaded, rather than when it is used.
